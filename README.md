# Socket.IO Realtime Dashborad

Although there is a great deal of power in bidirectional communication, Socket.IO is also
a perfect tool for creating unidirectional real-time experiences. Many applications need to
have some sort of dashboard interface to display analytical data or to show the state of the
application data. For an application state that frequently changes, or if there are multiple users
changing the state, creating the dashboard in real time makes for a much better experience.
